  <h1>About Sean</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Sean Prewitt. I made the website for the world to learn a bit about my journey as a web developer, and to view many of my best projects. I am kind of new to this world of HTML Web creating, but as you can see I am progressing with every page I make. Thank you very much for being a part of my journey! I hope many of you enjoy and get inspired through the items you encounter on this page.
  <p>I was born in Downtown Marietta, ATL, Georgia. I grew up living in the small town of Kennesaw for 12 years before making a huge transition into Nairobi, Kenya. As soon as we could, my mother put my education into her own hands. She homeschooled me and my siblings until I and my sister finished high school. At first I didn't see "schooling at home" as a huge option for me, mainly because I love socializing and seeing with people my age. Right now where I stand, I thank her so much for going on and schooling us herself (with the help of a tutor). I learned so much more than that of a public school student. Staying at home begins to bore you which then makes you want to find something to consume time. I found my time being "wasted" in computers and technology. My mom soon began to notice my interest in programming and eventually signed me up for a small course over at a local university for computer and animation programming. I was placed in the advanced modules without going through Prep, and still I finished at the top of my class. I enjoy what I do because I have a passion for this. I belive I can revolutionize the combination of traditional art and technology. This is the reason I joined Moringa School in the late summer of 2017. I felt it was a must to expand my knowledge in digital media in order to accomplish my goals. Right now, I have a few projects I am working on, but soon, very soon, they will be complete.</p>
  <p>Thank you for visiting my website. I hope the items you encounter throughout will be enjoyable and inspiring!<p>
